								<p>I like to making music, taking pictures(for fun),painting,drawing and singing.I have been singing since i was two. My mom's side family are a bunch of singers, but inherited my singing from her. I would always in the shower when my mom would bathe me. I use to sing everywhere.I started music and painting since I was 9 when i went to the USA. I started playing the piano when I was 9 with an old up-right piano. Then on Christmas, the same year, I got my first electric piano. Then the year after that at my private elementary school, My teacher started me on recorder then I played the Alto Saxophone 6 months after I finished with the recorder.I was on Jazz Band for 3 years in my elementary school. Then two years after all that, i got an even bigger electric piano. Then last year, in 2015, I got a bas guitar. it was pretty badahh.Just then, last year, My dad's co-worker gave me a big full set of drums. I'm still learning how to play haha. </p>
                                <p>Ever since I played the Saxophone at my old school for 3 years, at My 8th grade year, I moved to Eliot Middle School. I played Piano in their Jazz Band and I also played the Xylophone and Clarinet in Concert Band. It was really fun. Now that I am in Highschool, I still do music. I am in Pasadena High School's Marching band and Drum line. For Marching Band, i played the Glockenspiel. I played the Vibraphone, Vibes 2, for Drum line. Our season ended a week ago. Drum line was really fun. Drumline got 2nd place in Scholastic B when we went to Las Vegas. It was awesome. Being in Band is kind of part of my life now. (also for p.e credits lol jk)</p>

								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/baby.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>My full name is Rudith Maxene Clavio and no, my middle name is Maxene.I was born at a Hospital in Malolos, Philippines in 2001. I am full Filipino. I was born and raised there until my mom found my step-dad in 2008 or 2009. I've lived here in California for about 6/7 years with my awesome dad and my awesome mom. My dad is an Engineer and he works at JPL which is frickin awesome. My mom is a housewife but she use to be an English teacher. My mom taught me a little english so In the Philippines, i knew more English than the kids in Kindergarten class. My mom raised me since and my REAL dad is gone and we dont talk about him because he is the worst person ever. My mom risked everything just for me. My dad has been my dad and he will always be my dad. Anyways, My dad got me into soccer and taekwondo. He also got me in swimming lessons when I came here in California. I've been into to soccer for 5 years now in AYSO. I play mid-field or Offense. In taekwondo, I am now a Junior Black Belt and I stopped for now but im going to come back soon. Ive been into taekwondo for 3 years.
                            </p>
                                <h2>Schooling</h2>
                                <p>Before I went to a public school called Eliot Middle School, I went to a Private School in Fair Oaks. It was a good school because It taught me a lot of things that can prepare me for Public Schools. The School also taught me a lot of Math because in the Philippines, my teacher is always gone and Math was never my subject. I was good in English, Science and History. I really liked those subjects.
                                </p>

I also make patches using my sewing machine or a needle and thread. I like designing a lot. Ive been doing designing for like 4 years now. I paint and I draw. I mainly draw face parts, like lips,eyes, eyebrows, etc.... I like to experiment with eye drawing and put (real) make up on my drawing sometimes. Its really fun. I also draw furnitures and design furnitures and stuff. I really love to design because i can do whatever I want. Designing is always going to be part of my life and im really happy that i'm able to do stuff like this. </p>
